        <h2>How We're Different</h2>
        <p>It's no secret that hand prosthetics have been around for a long time. However, other prosthetics lack is intuition. With the H.A.N.D., there is't a learning curve for using arguably the most useful part of your own body. Direct contact
            with the arm's tendons allows the user to move the prosthetic like they would move their own fingers.</p>

        <h2>What's the catch?</h2>
        <p>Though they may not seem like it, prosthetic limbs with the kind of intuitive applications we're aiming for are bleeding-edge technology. Unfortunately, that means research and development need to be paid for as well as production of the
            prostheses. To keep costs low, a financial advisor is on payroll to ensure only the exact minimum costs are passed on to the customer.</p>

        <h2>Current Challenges</h2>
        <p>The nature of the device using tendons and muscles in the arm alone means there's no easy way to control knuckles.This means that the device would need to either have rigid fingers, or include some kind of gesture/nerve response control
            for bending the fingers. Nervous system biotechnology's current unreliability being what spawned this apparatus in the first place, it would be preferable to find another method to control the knuckles.</p>
