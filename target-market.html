    <section>
        <p>This product will benefit amputees that have undergone disarticulation amputation (the amputation of the hand at the wrist).</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>In order to use the device, the extensor digitorum tendons (control primary four fingers) and flexor pollicis longus tendon (controls thumb) must still be intact.</p>

        <p>Though the target market for this prosthesis seems scarce, a study in 2005 found that more than 10,000 Americans had undergone wrist disarticulation amputaion. Given that only 24-56% of amputees even get a prosthesis to help them, it is
            evident that there is a need for this product.</p>
