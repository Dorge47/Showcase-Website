        <h2>A specific kind of amputation</h2>
        <p>This product will benefit amputees that have undergone disarticulation amputation (the amputation of the hand at the wrist). This specific type of amputation ensures everything below the wrist is preserved, including the muscles and
            tendons used to control finger movement, the H.A.N.D.'s primary feature.</p>

        <h2>Why disarticulation?</h2>
        <p>In order to use the device, the flexor digitorum profundus tendons (control primary four fingers) and flexor pollicis longus tendon (controls thumb) must still be intact. The flexor digitorum profundus splits before the wrist, so
            disarticulation would not hinder finger movement. The flexor pollicis longus is typically located almost entirely within the forearm due to the thumb's proximity to the wrist, so amputating the hand does not adversely affect this tendon.
            There are other tendons that control finger and thumb movement that may not be easily reattached, but the main two should cover the most basic digital movement (movement of the fingers, or digits).</p>

        <p>Though the target market for this prosthesis seems scarce, a study in 2005 found that more than 10,000 Americans had undergone wrist disarticulation amputaion, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2743731/" title="Raichle, Katherine A et al. “Prosthesis use in persons with lower- and upper-limb amputation” Journal of rehabilitation research and development vol. 45,7 (2008): 961-72."
                target="_blank">about 5.6% of all amputations are wrist disarticulation</a>. Given that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2743731/#S1title" title="Raichle, Katherine A et al. “Prosthesis use in persons with lower- and upper-limb amputation” Journal of rehabilitation research and development vol. 45,7 (2008): 961-72."
                target="_blank">only 24-56% of amputees even get a prosthesis to help them</a>, it is evident that there is a need for this product.</p>
