        <h2>What it is</h2>
        <p>The Handicap Apparatus for Normal Disarticulation (H.A.N.D.) is an artificial hand designed for amputees that have undergone disarticulation amputation. A variety of optional artificial dermal coverings are sold separately to give the
            appearance of a natural hand for those that desire it. Any profit generated from the sale of dermal coverings go directly to research and development costs in an attempt to lower the price of the prosthesis.</p>

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>The device uses pre-existing tendons and muscles to control the fingers, making movement feel more natural than the gesture control typical of upper limb prostheses. It is made of a lightweight, durable material that will not irritate the
            skin it is attached to. While this is ideal for comfort, it is also more expensive than alternative materials. The prosthetic fingers attach directly to whatever tendons are available from the amputee's arms, giving varying levels of
            control to each patient.</p>
